## Big Data Assignemnt 5 

### Objective
To find the two closest moving vessels in a particular sea area and visualize their trajectory 10 minutes before rendezvous time and 10 minutes after.  

### Requirements
Python 3.x  
Data dataset: AIS Data http://web.ais.dk/aisdata/  

### Assignment
The provided dataset contains Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for vessels, including details such as MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity), timestamp, latitude, and longitude.   
Students will need to find the closest vessels in the area of a 50 km circle area, where the circle center coordinate is Latitude: 55.225000, Longitude: 14.245000 in the date range of December 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021. Please ensure that the found vessel isnâ€™t a noise.  

### Output
The final output should be the MMSI and names of the vessels that were closed in this area and their 20-minute trajectory visualization around the rendezvous moment.  
Code Documentation and Comments
Ensure the code is well-documented, explaining key transformations and actions used in the process.   

### Deliverables
The Python code of the solution.  
A brief report or set of comments within the code that discusses the findings and any interesting insights about the data or the computation process.
